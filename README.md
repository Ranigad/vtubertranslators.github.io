I just did this on a whim. I was messing with some unofficial YouTube apps and decided to use the subscriptions exported from them in this web page.

I decided to keep the code simple. I could probably use the YouTube API to grab images and more info but I decided not to. I've never used YouTube's API before, but I do know that **using an API adds more "moving parts" to maintain**.

If you were to ask me who this would be for, I'd say it's for people who:

- are new to JP VTubers
- can't speak Japanese
- want more and wished there was an easy way to find other translators
