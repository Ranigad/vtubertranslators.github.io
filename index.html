        <p>I just did this on a whim. I was messing with some unofficial YouTube apps and decided to use the subscriptions exported from them in this web page.</p>

        <p>I decided to keep the code simple. I could probably use the YouTube API to grab images and more info but I decided not to. I've never used YouTube's API before, but I do know that <strong>using an API adds more "moving parts" to maintain</strong>.</p>

        <p>If you were to ask me who this would be for, I'd say it's for people who:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>are new to JP VTubers</li>
            <li>can't speak Japanese</li>
            <li>want more and wished there was an easy way to find other translators</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
